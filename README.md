# Cervical Cancer Awareness: India

## Our Mission

As medical professionals specializing in cancer prevention and treatment, we have witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of cervical cancer on women in India. This project aims to create a centralized, open-source resource to combat misinformation and improve access to accurate information about cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine. Our focus is on addressing the unique challenges faced by women in India, including cultural barriers, limited healthcare access, and widespread myths surrounding vaccination.

We believe that education and awareness are powerful tools in the fight against cervical cancer. By collaborating with healthcare workers, volunteers, and community leaders, we can create culturally sensitive materials that empower women to make informed decisions about their health. This repository serves as a hub for educational content, resource directories, and collaborative efforts to increase vaccination coverage and screening rates across India.

## Call for Collaboration

This is an open-source initiative, and we welcome contributions from anyone passionate about public health. Whether you are a healthcare professional, a translator, a researcher, or simply someone who wants to help, your skills are valuable. Together, we can build a comprehensive resource that saves lives.
