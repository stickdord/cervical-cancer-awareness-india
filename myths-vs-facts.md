# Myths vs. Facts: HPV Vaccine in India

This document addresses common misconceptions about the HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccine in the Indian context. Each myth is countered with evidence-based facts to support informed decision-making.

## Myth 1: The HPV vaccine causes infertility.
**Fact:** Extensive global research, including studies by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has confirmed that HPV vaccines are safe and do not affect fertility. On the contrary, by preventing cervical cancer—a leading cause of cancer‑related deaths among Indian women—the vaccine helps preserve reproductive health. Cervical cancer can lead to infertility due to necessary treatments like hysterectomy; vaccination reduces this risk.

## Myth 2: HPV vaccine is only for girls.
**Fact:** The HPV vaccine is recommended for **both girls and boys**. While the primary goal is to prevent cervical cancer in women, vaccinating boys reduces the spread of HPV to their partners and protects them from other HPV‑related cancers, such as cancers of the penis, anus, and oropharynx. Many countries, including India, are moving toward gender‑neutral vaccination programs to achieve herd immunity and maximize public health benefits.

## Myth 3: HPV vaccine promotes promiscuity.
**Fact:** There is **no scientific evidence** that receiving the HPV vaccine leads to earlier or riskier sexual behavior. Numerous studies have shown that vaccination does not change sexual attitudes or practices. The HPV vaccine is a preventive health measure, much like vaccines against hepatitis B or tetanus. Educating adolescents about the vaccine as a cancer‑prevention tool, rather than linking it to sexual activity, is key to overcoming this stigma.
